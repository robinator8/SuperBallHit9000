# FAQ
Where is the source code?

I built this game using a school issued laptop that I no longer have access to. Unfortunately I did not transfer the source code so it's gone forever.

What the features of the game?

Four paddles on each side of the screen. Bricks in the center of the screen. You must destroy all the bricks. There are multiple different powerups that change the side of specific paddles and turn on a 'sticky' mode.

Why are you using a google drive download link?
